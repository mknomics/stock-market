## About
This process involves using the AlphaAdvantage API to retrieve historical stock data. The API provides access to various types of financial data, including time series for stocks, economic indicators, and cryptocurrencies. By querying the API, users can extract detailed information such as weekly stock prices, including open, high, low, close, and volume data for global equities. The data is structured in formats like JSON or CSV and can span over 20 years of historical information. The API uses HTTP requests, which can be sent programmatically using libraries like Python's Requests. This setup allows users to seamlessly integrate stock data retrieval into their projects, offering valuable insights into stock performance and trends over time.
